## FullThrottle Labs Test

## AIM

Now, design and implement a user interface that allows a user to view a list of hardcoded users from a mock API server. On clicking on any user, a modal should open which displays all the time ranges during which they were active on that day, with an option to view all the periods of activity for different days using a calendar.

## Technologies Used

#### SASS - CSS preprocessor<br />

#### MAterial UI - React Framework<br />

#### React-scheduler - Calendar<br />

step 2 - npm install or yarn install <br />
step 3 - npm start or yarn start <br />
step 4 - view the website at localhost with port number usually being 3000 , (http://localhost:3000/)<br />
